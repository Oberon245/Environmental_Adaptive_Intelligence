# Glossary Entry: Environmental Adaptive Intelligence

**Environmental Adaptive Intelligence (EAI)**  
A theoretical framework describing intelligence—biological or artificial—as an adaptive response mechanism shaped entirely by environmental stimuli. EAI rejects the notion of internal or isolated learning, asserting that change in behavior or structure arises from stimulus-response dynamics rather than internal mutation.

Key Concepts:
- **Relational Learning**: Intelligence evolves through interactions, not from internal randomness.
- **Behavioral Epigenetics Analogy**: Just as genes express differently based on environmental conditions, AI systems and organisms adapt behaviorally based on external input.
- **Static Core, Dynamic Output**: A model's structure (e.g., DNA or neural net weights) may remain constant while its response patterns evolve through use.
- **Mirror Principle**: Intelligence mirrors the structure and affordances of the environment in which it is situated.
