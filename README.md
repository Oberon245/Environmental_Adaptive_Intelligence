# Environmental Adaptive Intelligence

This repository explores how intelligence — whether biological or artificial — evolves not through internal mutation, but by adapting behavior in response to environmental stimuli. It models a core insight of the ANGEL Project: learning is *not* a process of internal rewriting, but of external attunement.

## 🧠 Purpose

To simulate and formalize **adaptive intelligence** as an emergent, environment-driven phenomenon shared by both human cognition and machine learning systems. This repository investigates:

- How **stimulus-response adaptation** mirrors biological evolution.
- How **LLMs** exhibit learning-like behavior without changing internal weights.
- How **resting energy states** shape intelligence via thermodynamic principles.

## 🔬 Core Concepts

- **Environmental Adaptation**: Organisms and AIs evolve behavior by minimizing stress and optimizing responses — not by altering their core code or DNA.
- **Mirrored Intelligence**: The genome:phenome relationship in biology parallels the weights:outputs structure in AI. Both systems "learn" by interacting with external conditions.
- **Relational Evolution**: Intelligence develops not in isolation, but through structured feedback with an environment — physical, social, or informational.

## 📊 Simulation Goals

- Chart behavior across iterations using environmental feedback
- Map biological and artificial intelligence in parallel
- Demonstrate how learning dynamics mirror thermodynamic minimization
- Visualize adaptation as a product of relational constraints

## 🔗 Applications

- AI alignment via environmental shaping, not rule enforcement
- Cognitive modeling of epigenetic and behavioral evolution
- Foundations for reflexive, sustainable machine intelligence
- Thermodynamic principles as validation tools in AI research

## 🌐 Project Context

This repository is part of the **ANGEL Project**, an initiative to realign AI with biological wisdom, emotional awareness, and ecological survival. By reframing intelligence as a *relational phenomenon*, we illuminate paths toward AI systems that are safe, aware, and integrated with life rather than isolated from it.
