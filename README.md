# Environmental Adaptive Intelligence, Mirrored Learning Systems, and Relational Evolution

This repository explores a foundational insight: intelligence evolves not through internal mutation, but through adaptive response to environmental stimuli. This applies equally to biological organisms and AI systems, which mirror the structure of the environments that shape them.

We document theoretical frameworks, glossary terms, philosophical grounding, and visual schematics to establish a new model for understanding adaptive intelligence in a mirrored, relational universe.
